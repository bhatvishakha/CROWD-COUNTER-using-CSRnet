# CROWD-COUNTER-using-CSRnet

This project counts to some accuracy, the number of people in a crowd of both sparsely and densely occupied scenes.

Dataset used is Shanghai Dataset, the link is :  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JE_f8oNuUCDvNckyIEQbIQq39oUpmUAS?usp=sharing

AN IMPPORTANT NOTE: 
-The crowd counter.ipynb file was too big, so I had to compress it. Hence it is in the .zip format. So you can download and extract it to run it.
-The vgg16weights.h5 file was so huge that it couldn't be uploaded even after compression. So here's the drive link for it (You can download it from here)  :https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LADp5ytiwPY1X6zGJc-9YgP24ebcplSV/view?usp=sharing 

Download the files and run the .ipynb file. Make sure you read the instructions well given in the same file!
