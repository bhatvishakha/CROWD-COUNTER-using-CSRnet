AN IMPPORTANT NOTE: 

-The vgg16weights.h5 file was so huge that it couldn't be uploaded even after compression. So here's the drive link for it (You can download it from here)  :https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LADp5ytiwPY1X6zGJc-9YgP24ebcplSV/view?usp=sharing 

Download the files and run the .ipynb file. Make sure you read the instructions well given in the same file!
